Spotifinder

Spotifinder is a simple application that uses HTML, Foundation CSS, and javascript to make api calls to spotify to display artists and show their top tracks. This project was a collaboration by Mike Bannoura, Nick Keller, Jon Spencer, and Riley Costello. 

The user is first presented with our login page and about us section. When the user chooses to login they will be brought to spotify's login. After they have completed logging in the user will be brought to our search engine page. Then the user can input whichever artist they choose into the search bar. Then the user will be presented with results below corresponding to what the user has put into the search bar. Then the user can also view the artists top tracks.
